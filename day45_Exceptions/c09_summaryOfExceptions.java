/*
    checked exception occur at complile time. Must be handled automatically
    ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception
    checked exceptions can NOT be thrown manually
    try catch blocks handle exceptions
    in catch block, a variable must be given with the exception class that can handle the exception
    I can pass the exception class or it's super class (parent class)
    we can use multi catch block BUT only one try block (just like if statement - only one if but multiple else if is allowed)
    To Handle exception in multi-catch blocks, either the exception class or it's parent class must be passed
    If we pass any other class that doesn't match what's mentioned above ==> exception will not be handled
    class must be passed first in multiple catch blocks then the parent class
    we can not pass parent class in a catch block before it's child class ==> compile error
