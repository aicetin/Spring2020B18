       1. create an interface named downloadable:

    1. create an interface named AndroidApps that can inherit from downloadable interface
            variable: AppStoreName
    2. create an interface named AppleApps that can inherit from downloadable interface
            variable: AppStoreName
    3. create an abstract class named Phone
            variables: brand, model, price, size
            abstract methods: texting(), calling()
    4. create a class named iPhone that can inherit from AppleApps interface
            actions that every iphone can do: texting(), calling(), faceTiming(), selfie()
    5. create a class named Nokia that can inherit from AndroidApps interface
            actions that Nokia can do: texting(), calling(), freezing(), breakTheFloor()
    in each sub classes of phone, create a constructor to initialize the instances
