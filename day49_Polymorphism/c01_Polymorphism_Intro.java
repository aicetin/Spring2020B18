/*
Polymorphism:
    * means the ability of object to take many forms
    * it is when reference type is a parent class /interface and object type is child
    * ex1:
        class Dog extends Animal
        Dog dog1 = new Dog(); // new object created
        Applying polymorphism ==> I can give the super class name Animal to create the object from Dog
        Animal dog2 = new Dog();
    * ex2:
        ChromeDriver is a class that inherited from interface WebDriver
        WebDriver is parent interface of ChromeDriver ==>
        when we create an object from ChromeDriver we can use the super type interface name as the reference
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    * ex3:
        class Cat extends Animal
        class Bird extends Animal
        class Dog extends Animal
        Dog dog1 = new Dog();
        Cat cat1 = new Cat();
        Bird bird1 = new Bird();
        Now if I want to create an array and store all these different objects in that array, what can I have as reference type?
        I can't have my reference type as Dog, or Cat or Bird
        ==> But because of polymorphism I can make reference type Animal and create Animal[] array to contain them all
         POLYMORPHISM   :   SUPER CLASS CAN BE REFERENCE TYPE OF SUB CLASSES' OBJECTS (SUB CLASS CAN NOT BE ABSTRACT
                            IF SUPER CLASS IS ABSTRACT IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ITS OWN OBJECTS
                            BUT IT CAN STILL BE REFERENCE TYPE FOR ITS SUB (NON-ABSTRACT) CLASSES' OBJECTS
                            SUPER TYPE INTERFACE CAN BE REFERENCE TYPE FOR SUB CLASSES OBJECTS
                            ABSTRACT CLASS AND INTERFACE:
                                            ARE MEANT TO BE REFERENCE TYPE
                                            CAN NEVER BE IN OBJECT TYPE (CAN NOT CREATE THEIR OWN OBJECT)
                            SUB CLASS CAN NEVER BE REFERENCE TYPE OF SUPER CLASS OBJECTS
         Animal  dog1 = new Dog();       // super class can be reference type to the sub class object
         Animal cat1 = new Cat();        // super class can be reference type to the sub class object
         Animal bird1 = new Bird();      // super class can be reference type to the sub class object
         Animal[] arr = { }
