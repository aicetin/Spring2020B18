    Task02:
        Create a class called Circle
                instance variables:
                        radius, pi, diameter
                add a constructor that can initialize the radius of the circle
                instance methods:
                        area(): can return the area of the circle as double
                        perimeter(): can return the perimeter of the circle as double
                        toString(): returns the info of the circle
                Note: global value of PI is 3.14
                      diameter of circle = 2 * radius
                      area of circle = PI * r * r
     */

    // Here we will add a constructor that can initialize the radius of circle: we assign its value to our instance variable radius

        // diameter must be instance because each circle will have its own diameter depending on radius (which is instance)
    }

    // here I will create instance method to calculate area of circle like this:
    public double areaOfCircle(){ // must be instance method because we are using an instance variable in here
        return  pi * radius*radius; // even though we are using a static variable BUT we are also using an instance one ==> instance method

    }

        return 2*radius*pi;  // even though we are using a static variable BUT we are also using an instance one ==> instance method
        //  return diameter*pi; //(because diameter = 2*radius)

    // here I will create my toString method to specify how I want my circle info printed:
