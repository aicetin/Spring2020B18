/*
static block vs instance block vs Constructor
1. static block gets executed first as soon as class runs (even before print anything in main method
2. static block gets executed once (for all objects)
3. instance block depends on object: NO OBJECT = NO execution of instance block. It runs before Constructor
4. constructor: depends on the object: NO OBJECT = NO execution: Executes once we create object ==> runs after instance block
