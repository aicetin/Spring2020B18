/*
    How many kinds of variables do we have? Local, Instance, Static
    If I want to have any value for a variable as constant (never changing) I can make it final
    It can NOT be re-assigned
    1. Variables: Final variable can NEVER BE RE-ASSIGNED
                 final local variables can be declared before initializing (but can't be used till it is initialized)
                 final instance variables MUST be initialized immediately.
                 final static variable MUSt be initialized immediately .
                 Can NEVER generate Setter for final private variables to re-assign its data,
                 but you can generate getter for final private variables to get the data.
