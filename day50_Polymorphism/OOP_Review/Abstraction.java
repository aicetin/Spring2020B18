Abstraction:
          - hiding the implementation details
          - concentrating on essentials/ important, without worrying about details
          - ChromeDriver, FireFoxDriver, OperaDriver are all classes
          - all these classes can do a common action: get() and quit() .
          - WebDriver:
                - get();    // abstract method to be overridden to give different implementation
                - quit();   // abstract method to be overridden to give different implementation
            - ChromeDrive implements WebDriver:
                - get(): opens chrome
                - quit(): closes chrome only
            - FireFoxDriver implements WebDriver:
                 - get(): opens firefox
                - quit(): closes firefox only
            - OperaDriver implements WebDriver:
                - get(): opens opera
                - quit(): closes opera only
          - Abstract method:
                - method without body/implementation
                - meant to be overridden
                - abstract method can not be final
                - abstract method can not be static
                - abstract method can not be private
                - abstract method can be overloaded
          - To achieve abstraction : you can use two ways: Abstract class OR Interface
                - Abstract class:
                    - not concrete
                    - can not create object
                    - meant to be inherited
                    - abstract class can NOT be final
                    - use "extends" keyword to inherit
                    - sub class can extend one abstract class (one class in general)
                    - abstract class can have all methods and all variables
                - Interface:
                    - Sub class can implement multiple interfaces
                    - can NOT create object
                    - meant to be inherited
                    - interface can NOT be final
                    - use "implements" keyword to inherit from interface into a class
                    - "extends" keyword must be used before "implements" keyword when inheriting from class and interface
                    - use "extends" keyword to inherit form interface to interface
                    - Everything has public access modifier
                    - can only have :
                                static final variables (by default)
                                abstract or static or default methods
                    - can NOT have:
                                constructor
                                instance variables
                                instance methods
                                blocks
