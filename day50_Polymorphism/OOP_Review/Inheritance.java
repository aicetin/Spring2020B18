   Inheritance:
           - build super class and sub class
           - easy way to get rich by inheriting from super class
           - super class:  Only gives. Can not inherit anything from child class.
           - sub class: can inherit visible variables and methods from super class (visible according to am) except cnstructor
           - sub class uses "extends" keyword to inherit from super class: class A extends B{ }
           - sub class uses "implements" keyword to inherit from interface/interfaces: class A extends B implements C,D{  }
           - Inheritance is pre-condition for polymorphism and for overriding methods
           - method overriding must happen in sub class
           - advantages of inheritance:
                   - less codes
                   - reusable
                   - easy to maintain
           - PUBLIC or PROTECTED access modifier are visible anywhere in sub classes
           - DEFAULT access modifier is only visible in the same package sub classes
           - Instance & Static variables can be inherited
