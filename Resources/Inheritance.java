public = accessible at everywhere, visible to world
protected = visible in same package, visible in sub class outside package
default = only visible in same package
private = only visible within the same class
private:     can never be inherited in sub class
default:     can be inherited as long as sub class is in the same package
protected:   can be inherited always to any subclass
public:      can be inherited always to any subclass
To sort according to visibility: PUBLIC > PROTECTED > DEFAULT > PRIVATE
