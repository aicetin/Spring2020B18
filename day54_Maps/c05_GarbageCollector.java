/*
JVM runs a process called garbage collector that deletes any unreferenced object
2 ways:
    - by nulling the object
    - by reassigning
If an object was referenced by a variable and later was re-assigned ==> garbage collector will collect it
Compiler calls .finalize() method internally .
finalize() method: does the role of cleaning up unreferenced object
