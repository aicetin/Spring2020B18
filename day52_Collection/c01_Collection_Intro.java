Data Structure:
    - Array
    - Collection
    - Maps
We need data structure to manage data efficiently and in an organized matter
Array vs ArrayList
Array size is fixed, ArrayList size is Dynamic
Array supports primitives and objects, ArrayList supports only objects
Array can be multi-dimentioal, ArrayList can not be multi- dimentional
Array has index number, and accepts duplicates. ArrayList also has index number and accepts duplicates
To sort any array => we used Arrays.sort(arrayname) method
To sort any collection ==> we can use Collections.sort(collectionname) method
Collection framework: consists of multiple interfaces
    Collection is a group of individual objects as a single entity
    Collection size is dynamic = can increase or decrease
    Can hold different data types
    All these classes and interfaces are presented in "java.util"
    Each of those interfaces in collection framework has multiple implementations
    Collection has a parent interface called: Iterable (I) [(I) stands for Interface]
Iterable (I): root interface. It is super type of all interfaces in collections framework
Collection(I): is an interface that consists of 3 interfaces: List(I), Queue(I), and Set(I)
               These interfaces inherit from Collection by using extends keyword
               ArrayList(C) inherited from List(I)
               By making List(I) as reference type, I can create object from ArrayList(C), LinkedList(C), Vector(C), Stack(C)
List(I): extends Collection(I)
         implemented by ArrayList(C), extended by Queue(I)
         has index numbers (not ordered)
         accepts duplicates (duplicated value)
         size is dynamic
