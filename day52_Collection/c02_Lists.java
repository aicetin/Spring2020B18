/*
ArrayList(C) = implements List (I)
            is an array based class
            internally uses array
            singly linked list (objects are singly linked)
            ==> much faster in terms of retrieving data (get() method) ==> it is used a lot
            ==> much slower in adding or removing elements (remove() method, add() method)
LinkedList(C) = implements List (I)
            is doubly linked list (objects are doubly linked)
            ==> much slower in terms of retrieving data1
            ==> much faster in adding or removing elements
Vector (C) = implements List (I)
            is an array based class
            actions of Vector are synchronized
This is how the method add() looks like in Vector:
          public synchronized boolean add(E e) {
        modCount++;
        ensureCapacityHelper(elementCount + 1);
        elementData[elementCount++] = e;
        return true;
    }
This is how the method add() looks link in ArrayList
         public boolean add(E e) {
        ensureCapacityInternal(size + 1);  // Increments modCount!!
        elementData[size++] = e;
        return true;
    }
SYNCHRONIZED in vector ==>
        Synchronized is used to achieve the thread safety
        Synchronized is slower
Thread:  is abstract
         it is the process of operating system for scheduling the object
         scheduling threads and prioritizing thread is the process of the operating system
         process of operating system scheduling object
         by using multi thread ==> allowing execution of multi thread to maximize utilization of CPU
ArrayList:  multiple threads can get access to ArrayList to execute at the same time
Vector:     multiple threads can get access to Vector to execute one by one ==> we achieve thread safety
            disadvantage is : synchronized is slower
            Only time Vector is preferred to be used when you have multi-thread
            it is extended by Stack(C) ==> Stack inherited from Vector
Stack(C):   extends Vector(C)
            Stack is also synchronized
            pop() method: Last in First out (only unique in the Stack class)
            pop() method: whatever object was added to stack ==> will be first to be removed
            (imagine husband and wife withdrawing money from same account from different ATM)
            (if not synchronized ==> might get no funds available)
            (But because synchronized ==> first one gets funded then balance is updated for second one)
multi-Thread: two or more threads are getting executed
Thread-Safety : one thread at a time
List(I):
         extends Collection(I)
         implemented by ArrayList(C), extended by Queue(I)
         has index numbers (not ordered)
         accepts duplicates (duplicated value)
         size is dynamic
Queue (I) :
            it is interface ==>
            size is dynamic
            does NOT have index numbers
            accepts duplicates
            has a unique method called poll()
            first in first out
            poll() method removes the first object added
Set (I):
        doesn't accept duplicates
        doesn't have index numbers
        size is dynamic
        Set is extended by SortedSet(I)
        SortedSet(I) is implemented by TreeSet(C) class
TreeSet(C):
        doesn't accept duplicates
        sorts the objects  ==> it is designed for sorting
null:
        default vlue of all reference type
        does not refer to any object
        WebElement element;         // null
        String str;                 // null
hashset :
        doesn't accept nul ker
